# Lung Cancer Prediction Using KNN

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict lung cancer based on medical data. It includes feature scaling, oversampling, and hyperparameter tuning using grid search.

## Features
- KNN model for lung cancer prediction.
- Data preprocessing (feature scaling and oversampling).
- Hyperparameter optimization with grid search.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## Usage
1. Load your dataset into the `lung_cancer_data.csv` file.
2. Run `main.py` to train the KNN model and evaluate its performance.
3. Modify the code to tune hyperparameters or test different configurations.
